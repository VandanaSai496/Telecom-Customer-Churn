# Telecom-Customer-Churn
**Telecom Customer Churn**

Customer churn refers to the phenomenon where customers discontinue their relationship with a company or brand. It is a crucial metric that measures the rate at which customers leave a business over a specific period. 
Churn can occur for various reasons, such as dissatisfaction with the product or service, competitive offers, or changes in personal circumstances, beyound these external factors, let's look at the information we collect as a company, and analyze what kind of customers are leaving our company or service. This is helping us look at the Bigger Picture and analyzing what kind of customers are our target market and who are the customers that are likely to churn and how can we try to retain them! I believe this is quite a crucial step as it's easier than onboarding new customers or anlyzing our customers can make it easier to onboard new customers.
