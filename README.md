# Telecom-Customer-Churn
**Telecom Customer Churn**

Customer churn refers to the phenomenon where customers discontinue their relationship with a company or brand. It is a crucial metric that measures the rate at which customers leave a business over a specific period. 
Churn can occur for various reasons, such as dissatisfaction with the product or service, competitive offers, or changes in personal circumstances, beyound these external factors, let's look at the information we collect as a company, and analyze what kind of customers are leaving our company or service. This is helping us look at the Bigger Picture and analyzing what kind of customers are our target market and who are the customers that are likely to churn and how can we try to retain them! I believe this is quite a crucial step as it's easier than onboarding new customers or anlyzing our customers can make it easier to onboard new customers. 

I've taken a telecom company dataset, this is a fiticonal dataset.Telecom industry is no different with respect to customer churn. Let's try and understand our dataset first.

In our dataset, we have different types of information of our customers.

a) Demographic Information : This refers to the customer's gender, age group, location etc. 
b) Account-level Information: This refers to the information specific to their accountwith the company
c) Services Information: This is the kind of services they've opted for

Here are the steps we are following in this project:
**Data Reading**  --> **Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Cleaning --> **Data Visualization --> Feature Importance  --> Feature Engineering --> Setting a baseline --> Splitting the data in training and testing sets
--> Assessing multiple algorithms --> Algorithm selected: Gradient Boosting--> Hyperparameter tuning--> Performance of the model--> Drawing conclusions â€” Summary
